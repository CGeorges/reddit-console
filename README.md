Reddit Console
==============

This is an example application intended to illustrate the installation and usage
of the [PHP Reddit API client](https://github.com/h2s/reddit-api-client). Even
so, here's how to use the application itself:

    $ git clone git@github.com:h2s/reddit-console.git
    $ cd reddit-console
    $ ./bin/reddit-console subreddit:show programming
    How to determine if my calculation of pi is accurate?
